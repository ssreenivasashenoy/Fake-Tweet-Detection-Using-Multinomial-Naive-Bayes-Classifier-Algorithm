# Fake Tweet Detection Using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm

"Fake Tweet Detection Using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm" is a project that aims to develop a machine learning model to identify fake tweets on social media platforms such as Twitter. The project utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm, which is a probabilistic algorithm commonly used for text classification tasks.

The model is trained on a dataset of tweets labeled as either real or fake. The dataset is preprocessed by removing stop words, stemming, and tokenization to transform the text data into a format that can be used for modeling. The Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm then uses these features to calculate the probability of a tweet being real or fake.

The project aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying fake tweets, which can help reduce the spread of false information on social media platforms. The model can also be further improved by incorporating other machine learning algorithms or using more advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Prerequisites
